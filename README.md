# TASK 2
- The base class is Item, which extends Menu which extends Waiter
- The ```main.py``` file is the file one should run.


**Explanation**
- The Waiter class creates a waiter to take orders and show menus
- The Menu class is really just a list of Item objects
- Each Item object has a name and a price associated with it
---
- In the main.py file, I create a sample menu and create a waiter to hold that menu
- The waiter will then ask the user on what they would like to do
